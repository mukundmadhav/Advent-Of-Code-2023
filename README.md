# Advent of Code 2023 - Java Solutions


Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code 2023! This repository contains Java solutions for the programming challenges presented in Advent of Code 2023.


Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge where participants solve a series of coding puzzles, one for each day of December leading up to Christmas. The challenges cover various topics and difficulty levels, making it a fun and engaging way to improve your coding skills.

## Repository Structure

```lua
|-- src
|   |-- main
|       |-- java
|           |-- Day1
|               |-- Solution1.java
|               |-- Solution2.java
|           |-- Day2
|               |-- Solution1.java
|               |-- Solution2.java
|           |-- ...
|-- input
|   |-- day1.txt
|   |-- day2.txt
|   |-- ...
```

The src directory contains packages for each day, and within each day's package, you'll find Java files (Solution1.java, Solution2.java, etc.) for each part of the day's challenge. The input directory contains input files for each day.

## Getting Started

To get started with the solutions, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mukundmadhav/Advent-Of-Code-2023.git
cd Advent-Of-Code-2023`
```

Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.

## How to Run the Solutions

Navigate to the day you want to run and use Java to execute the solution file. For example, to run Day 1, Part 1:

```bash
cd src/main/java/Day1
javac Solution1.java
java Solution1
```

Repeat the process for other parts and days.
